Assuming you're using the Waveshare Raspberry Pi GSM/GPRS/GNSS Bluetooth Hat for SIM868's I keep talking about:
    https://amazon.com/Raspberry-Bluetooth-Expansion-Compatible-DataTransfer/dp/B076CPX4NN

What it do, tho?
The setup_commands do the following, in order:
    1. Deactivate any existing bearer context
    2. Attach the GPRS services on the HAT module
    3. Set the bearer content type to GPRS
    4. Set the APN type to "default,supl,mms" (should work for most carriers, but google 'APN type' for your carrier, if not)
    5. Activate the configured bearer context
And then we're ready to fuck.

This script clearly doesn't do any sort of error, failure, or success checking, and I don't know
if I can be bothered to write any. I'm not going to make claims about my knowledge of this subject
matter; all I'm going to say is that it's complicated, ultra-specific, and will not work for anything
that even slightly deviates from the mashup of SIM800 and SIM900 commands available on the SIM868.
I haven't actually checked if this script works     XD
